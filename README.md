# Pantone API Coding

You are tasked with building an API that allows web clients to query [Pantone colors](https://www.pantone.com/).

The data served by the API should be sourced from two files, provided at [pantone-colors.json](./data/pantone-colors.json) and [pantone-numbers.json](./data/pantone-numbers.json).

## Requirements:

- You may use the language and/or framework of your choice. 
- The choice of how to structure the queries and returned data is yours to make.
- The API should be efficient and ergonomic. 
- Demonstrate selection and correct use of an APIs methodology (e.g. REST practices, GraphQL). 
- Consideration for exceptional circumstance.
- Consideration for packaging, tests, and deployment. 
- Specification of a few interesting API extensions, such as a color blending endpoint.


## Bonuses

- Implementations for the described API extensions.
- Add a simple user interface for the APIs.
- Consideration for access control and mutations.
